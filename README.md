# Food Truck Project

## Description
1.I created the FoodTruck's class used to generate and set user input, i also create the methods for FoodTruckApp to call.

2.In the FoodTruckApp, I created the numOfTrucks in order to let the user to choose how many trucks they want to input, so that in the menu step, i can only get the truck's name. Otherwise, if the array is limit to 5 by hard code, the rest truck info which user did not input will show null.

3.Also, i use the while loop to let the user input truck information.

4.In the menu step, I use the for loop to get the average rating, as numbers just need to increment.

5.For the highest rating, I used the for loop and if statement, to find out which rating is the highest.
Then use the for loop to print out the FoodTruck's name who owns the highest rating.
## Lesson Learned
1.FoodTruck class set up is important for others to refer.
2.for loop, while loop, and array need be very family and can combine together.

## Technologies Used
git, atom, Eclipse
